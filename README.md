# Object Detection and Localization Framework using Modified YOLOv5

## Project Overview

This project was created during my B.Tech final semester under the guidance of Prof. Anup Nandy from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at NIT, Rourkela.

### Project Title
An Efficient Object Detection and Localization Framework using Modified YOLOv5

## Introduction

Object detection and localization are crucial tasks in computer vision, involving the identification, classification, and precise location determination of objects within images or video streams. Existing object detection systems often rely on various computer vision techniques, leading to slow and subpar performance.

This project addresses the challenges by focusing on single-stage object detection techniques like YOLO and experimenting with the modification of YOLOv5 architecture to enhance accuracy. Traditional YOLOv5 models may struggle with accuracy, especially in challenging environments with factors such as inadequate lighting, tiny or crowded objects, obscured views, low light, reflections, and partial object views.

### Methodology

In our approach, we take an end-to-end deep learning-based solution to the object detection problem. We utilize a hybrid feature extraction method incorporating Autoencoder, Canny edge extraction, and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to enhance accuracy, particularly for tiny and low-light images. The project introduces a novel approach for obtaining optimal anchor box sets using genetic algorithms and k-means clustering, significantly contributing to efficient object detection with improved precision.

### Dataset
The major objective of the proposed research project is to recognise items in a semi-structured environment with inadequate lighting, crowded objects, objects that are obscured by other objects, low light, reflecting surfaces, amorphous bodies, and partial views of an object. This was one of the biggest difficulties we ran across when carrying out this experiment. For this project, a custom dataset has been prepared. The dataset consists of eight different object classes: spoon, orange, apple, cup, cricket bat, bottle, wrist watch and banana. By taking pictures of the things and obtaining the photographs from Google, we were able to get 90 positive examples from each class with aggregating total of 720 images. The Dataset is divided into train and test set of 80 : 20 ratio.  The entire datasetâ€™s image is then scaled to 640 X 640 pixels as we have taken images of various scales. _**Note:**_ Here in this repo, I have attached _partial dataset for reference_ due to high memory size issues.

### Results

The modified YOLOv5 model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 95.8% and a total loss of 0.015%, showcasing a satisfying result. The proposed model outperforms traditional YOLOv5 and SSD Mobilenetv2 in terms of mAP score, loss, and frames per second (fps), making it a preferred choice for efficient object detection.
